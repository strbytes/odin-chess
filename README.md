Chess project for TOP. Using a more relaxed approach after focusing on TDD for the last two projects. So far just hacking up a little framework of base classes and functionality and I plan to use more deliberate planning methods including pre-designed tests later, especially for evaluating the legality of moves.

chess.py - Chess game

test_chess.py - Tests for chess.py (none currently implemented)

taskell.md - Kanban board for project managed with taskell
